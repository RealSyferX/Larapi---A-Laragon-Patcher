# 🧨 Larapi — A Laragon Patcher

A **no-nonsense patcher** for [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) that removes license checks, ads, and other restrictions.  
This tool makes Laragon quieter, cleaner, and more developer-friendly — no popups, no nags, no BS.

> ⚠️ **Closed-source** tool. Binaries only. Safe.

---

### 🎯 What It Does

- ✂️ Removes ad popups and nag screens
- 🔓 Bypasses invalid key and license validation
- 🧼 Strips license checks internally via AOB patching
- 🗃️ Automatically drops valid `license.info` and `license.key`
- ✅ Designed for `laragon.exe` (Windows builds)

---

### 🛠️ How It Works

Larapi uses **Array of Byte (AOB)** pattern scanning and patching to locate and rewrite instructions inside `laragon.exe`.  
All patch logic is built-in. One click, instant patch, no config needed.

---

### 📦 Output Location

After patching, these files are dropped to:

C:\Laragon\usr
├── license.info
└── license.key


---

### 🚀 How to Use

1. Download and run `Larapi.exe` as **Administrator**
2. Make sure `C:\Laragon\laragon.exe` exists
3. Click the **Patch** button
4. Done. Laragon is now fully patched and ad-free
